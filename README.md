---

### Steps:-

### Step 1: Install OWASP Juice Shop Using Docker :-

### If Docker is installed on your Kali Linux, you can set up OWASP Juice Shop with a single command. Here‚Äôs how:

### 1. Install Docker : Open your terminal and run the following commands:-

- sudo apt update

- sudo apt install docker.io

- sudo systemctl start docker

- sudo systemctl enable docker

---

### 2. Pull and Run OWASP Juice Shop: Run the following command to download and start OWASP Juice Shop via Docker:-

- sudo docker pull bkimminich/juice-shop - This command downloads the official OWASP Juice Shop image from Docker Hub.

- sudo docker run -d -p 3000:3000 bkimminich/juice-shop - After pulling the image, starts the Juice Shop container.

### Explanation of Each Part:

**sudo:**
- This runs the command with superuser (root) privileges, which is often needed to run Docker commands if your user is not part of the docker group.
If your user already has Docker permissions, you can omit this part.

**docker run:**
- This is the command to start a new Docker container based on an image. It tells Docker to create and run a container from a specified image.

**-d:**
- This flag stands for "detached mode". It runs the container in the background, so your terminal is free for other tasks. Without this flag, the container would run in the foreground, and you'd need to open a new terminal for other commands.

**-p 3000 : 3000:**
- This flag is used to map ports between your host machine and the container.

**3000:3000 means:**
- The first 3000 is the port on your host machine (your local computer).
The second 3000 is the port inside the Docker container where the Juice Shop web application is running.

- This maps the container‚Äôs port 3000 to your machine‚Äôs port 3000, allowing you to access the Juice Shop web app in your browser by visiting http://localhost:3000.

**bkimminich/juice-shop:**
- This is the Docker image name. bkimminich/juice-shop refers to the official Docker image for OWASP Juice Shop, which is maintained by Bj√∂rn Kimminich (the creator of Juice Shop).
If this image isn‚Äôt already downloaded to your machine, Docker will pull it from Docker Hub (an online repository of Docker images) before running the container.

---

## 3. Access Juice Shop: Once the container is running, you can access the Juice Shop web application by navigating to:-

- Search this url on the browser : http://localhost:3000

---

## Step 2: Perform a vulnerability assessment on the OWASP Juice Shop :-

- Set the Target URL (OWASP Juice Shop):-
Enter the target URL:

In OWASP ZAP, you‚Äôll see a browser-like interface at the top after selecting Automated Scan.

- Enter the target URL of Juice Shop (running on Docker): http://localhost:3000

- Then click on attack it will start the 2 types of scans

- Spider Scan:

This will crawl the Juice Shop application to identify all reachable pages.

- Active Scan:

This scan will actively test for vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, XSS, and more.
Review the Results:

- Once the scan completes, go to the Alerts tab.

- ZAP will list vulnerabilities along with their severity (e.g., Low, Medium, High).

- Document these vulnerabilities for your report.

---

## B. Tool Used : **Nmap** :-

- **Nmap (Network Mapper)** : Is an open-source tool used for network discovery and security auditing.It is primarily used to :-

- **Discover Hosts and Services**: Nmap identifies devices (hosts) on a network and determines which services (e.g., HTTP, FTP) are running on them.

- **Detect Operating Systems**: Nmap can attempt to detect the operating system (OS) running on remote devices.

- **Security Auditing**: Nmap helps in identifying potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in network devices and services.

---

## Common Nmap Functions :-

- **Host Discovery**: Find live hosts on a network.

Command : nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
This command pings all hosts in the network range to check which ones are up.

---

- **Port Scanning**: Scan for open ports on a target host.

Command : nmap -p 80,443 localhost
Scans ports 80 and 443 on the localhost.

---

- **Service Version Detection**: Determine the versions of services running on open ports.

Command : nmap -sV localhost
Scans and attempts to identify the version of services running on open ports.

---

- **Operating System Detection**: Identify the operating system of a remote host.

Command : nmap -O localhost
Attempts to detect the OS of the target system.

---

- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Scan for known vulnerabilities using Nmap scripts.


Command : nmap --script vuln localhost
Runs vulnerability scanning scripts on the target.

---

- **Service Enumeration**: Enumerate services running on a particular port, often useful for web applications.

Command : nmap --script http-enum -p 80 localhost
Uses Nmap scripts to enumerate HTTP services on port 80.

---

## Summary of Nmap Commands for Juice Shop on Port localhost 3000 :-

- **Basic Nmap scan on port 3000:**

Command: nmap -p 3000 localhost

Purpose: Scans port 3000 to check if it's open.

Expected Outcome: Port 3000 should show as open if OWASP Juice Shop is running.

---

- **Service version detection on port 3000:**

Command: nmap -sV -p 3000 localhost

Purpose: Tries to detect the version of the service running on port 3000.

Expected Outcome: If Juice Shop is running, the service version detection may not yield detailed results due to custom configurations (e.g., Node.js). Sometimes the service might be identified as HTTP or web server, but exact details may be missed.


![Screenshot 2025-01-25 221256](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08817da4-2c26-4e7b-8968-05e24c016e82)


---

- **Operating system detection on port localhost 3000:**

Command: nmap -O -p 3000 localhost

Purpose: Attempts to detect the operating system running on the machine hosting the service.

Expected Outcome: If the machine is a local VM or container, Nmap might not always identify the OS precisely, especially if it's a specialized system like Kali Linux or a Docker container.


---

- **Vulnerability scan on port localhost 3000:**

Command: nmap --script vuln -p 3000 localhost

Purpose: Runs a general vulnerability scan to find common security flaws.

Expected Outcome: If the OWASP Juice Shop is running, vulnerabilities may not be identified unless they're specifically known or targeted by one of the vuln scripts. Juice Shop itself is intentionally insecure, so many vulnerabilities will require targeted scanning beyond basic Nmap scripts.

---

- **Web vulnerability scanning on port localhost 3000:**

Command: nmap --script http-sql-injection,http-enum,http-vuln-cve2017-5638 -p 3000 localhost

Purpose: Uses specific Nmap scripts to check for common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection or known CVE vulnerabilities.

Expected Outcome: Juice Shop is designed with multiple vulnerabilities for educational purposes, but not all scanners might detect them unless they focus on specific issues (e.g., authentication bypass, XXS, etc.).

![Screenshot 2025-01-25 221417](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef16e928-3fb5-43cb-a99c-3982517478fa)


---

- **HTTP service enumeration on port localhost 3000:**

Command: nmap --script http-enum -p 3000 localhost

Purpose: Enumerates HTTP-related services (directories, common issues).

Expected Outcome: Nmap will try to identify any public directories or misconfigurations. However, Juice Shop might not trigger any obvious findings unless there are misconfigurations or exposed admin panels.

---

- Confirm Nmap Command:

If the service is running but nmap still doesn't detect it, ensure you‚Äôre running the correct scan. You could try scanning a range of ports or the entire localhost with:

Command : sudo nmap -p- localhost

- Port 39459 on localhost is open, but the service is unknown. This might be unrelated to OWASP Juice Shop, or it could be a different service running on your machine.

---

To identify and resolve the unknown service running on port 39459, you can follow these steps:

- Identify the Process Using Port 39459 :-

Use lsof (List Open Files) or netstat to identify which process is listening on port 39459:

- Using lsof:

Command : sudo lsof -i :39459

This will show the process name and PID associated with port 39459.

---

- Using netstat:

Command : sudo netstat -tulnp | grep 39459

---

- Or you can use ss:

Command : sudo ss -tulnp | grep 39459

Both of these commands will give you the PID (Process ID) of the application listening on that port, as well as the service name (if available).

![Screenshot 2025-01-26 132149](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fc4bc72-d26d-46d9-beaa-0df8d9ce1e5c)


---

- Service Version Detection: You can use the -sV flag, which enables version detection to get details about the service running on the open port.

Command : sudo nmap -sV -p 39459 localhost 3000
This will attempt to identify the service and version running on port 39459.

---

-  Service and Script Scan: You can combine version detection with the -sC option to run default scripts that provide additional information about the service.

Command : sudo nmap -sV -sC -p 39459 localhost 3000
This will not only try to detect the service version but also run some Nmap scripts (like those for banner grabbing or identifying vulnerabilities).

---

- Aggressive Scan Mode: You can use the -A option for a more aggressive scan, which includes OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.

Command : sudo nmap -A -p 39459 localhost 3000
These commands should help you gather more detailed information about the service running on port 39459 without needing manual investigation steps.

---

## Service Misconfiguration and Risks Identified :-

- Unnecessary Open Golang HTTP Service (Port 39459/tcp)

- Risk: The presence of an open HTTP service on port 39459 (Golang net/http) is concerning. This service seems to be misconfigured or not in use, as it returns 404 Not Found or 400 Bad Request responses. Attackers could potentially leverage it if left unmonitored, as it could be used for further attacks like a denial of service (DoS) or information gathering.

- Recommendation:
Disable or remove the service on port 39459 if it is unnecessary.
If the service is required, ensure it is properly configured, secure, and does not expose any sensitive information.
Monitor service behavior regularly to ensure it doesn't cause unexpected issues.

---

- Exposure of OWASP Juice Shop on Port 3000

- Risk: The OWASP Juice Shop web application running on port 3000 may be vulnerable to several OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), etc.). As Juice Shop is designed to be insecure for testing purposes, it is crucial to assess the application's own security measures.

- Recommendation:
Conduct a web application security assessment (e.g., using OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite) to identify vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, and others.
Ensure proper input validation and sanitization are applied in the application to prevent injection attacks.
Apply security patches to the Juice Shop application and other web services it integrates with.

---

- Lack of Service Information and Detection for Port 3000

- Risk: The service running on port 3000 did not return specific service information in the Nmap scan. While this is often a tactic to reduce information leakage, it can also indicate a potential misconfiguration that prevents proper identification of the service.

- Recommendation:
Ensure that the service on port 3000 is properly configured and its responses are appropriate for security auditing.
Limit information disclosure in HTTP headers to avoid giving attackers unnecessary details that could be exploited (e.g., application server details, version numbers).

---

- Insecure HTTP Service on Port 3000

- Risk: The service on port 3000 is accessible without encryption (HTTP instead of HTTPS), which means data could be intercepted in transit by an attacker. This exposes sensitive data such as login credentials to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

- Recommendation:
Implement HTTPS to encrypt communication between the client and the server.
Obtain and configure a valid SSL/TLS certificate for the server to secure web traffic and prevent interception.

---

5. Conclusion
The vulnerability scan conducted using Nmap uncovered several risks, including unnecessary services, the use of HTTP without encryption, and potential misconfigurations in the OWASP Juice Shop application.

## Key Recommendations to Mitigate Identified Risks :-

- Disable unused services, particularly the Golang net/http server on port 39459.

- Secure the OWASP Juice Shop application with HTTPS, ensuring encrypted communication.

- Regularly perform web application testing to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities.

- Monitor and manage services to ensure they do not leak unnecessary information or expose risks.

- Apply security patches to services and applications to reduce the attack surface.
